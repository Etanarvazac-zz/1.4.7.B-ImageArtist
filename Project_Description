Problem 1.4.7 – Client # 2: A Family
-->	Your client is a family that would like a standard frame applied to a large number of pictures that feature one or more of the 
family members. They want the composite image to be memorable and to incorporate some personalized symbol, image, or  silhouette that 
represents the interests of the family member(s). The client  enjoys abstract art as well and might like to see geometric shape 
incorporated in the image—drawn on, as a border, or as a mask.
-->	The client enjoys participating in the creative process and will appreciate being offered a range of options (as a parameter) for
one of the image operations you perform.
